# How a Graph Convolutionnal Network's forward pass works

In this project, I'm going to walk you through step by step forward mechanism of a GCN. And after this tutorial, 

you will understand more about the basics of Graph Neural Networks. It will be helpful if you know a little 

knowledge about graph networks like what an adjacency matrix, the degree of a node, a degree matrix,... are. 

I will try to explain everything in a clear way so you can follow along without any difficulty.

## Abbreviation

| Terminology | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
