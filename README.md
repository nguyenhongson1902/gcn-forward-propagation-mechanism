# How a Graph Convolutionnal Network's forward pass works

In this project, I'm going to walk you through step by step forward mechanism of a GCN. And after this tutorial, 
you will understand more about the basics of Graph Neural Networks. It will be helpful if you know a little 
knowledge about graph networks like what an adjacency matrix, the degree of a node, a degree matrix,... are. 
I will try to explain everything in a clear way so you can follow along without any difficulty.

## Abbreviation

| Terminology | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| GCN      | Graph Neural Network       |
| CNN   | Convolutional Neural Network        |


## Key things that make GCNs different from CNNs
1. Basically, the term "convolution" in GCN and CNN is similar regarding "weight sharing" mechanism.
2. 

## Keywords
Graph convolutional network, Convolutional Neural Network, Message passing, Fast approximation
